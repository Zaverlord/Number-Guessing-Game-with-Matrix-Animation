# Number-Guessing-Game-with-Matrix-Animation
This is a Python-based Number Guessing Game using Tkinter for the GUI and an interactive Matrix-style animation as a background effect. The player must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. A fun smiley face animation is displayed when the correct number is guessed.
